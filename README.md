# Project overview
It's the repository for the DevOps course from the Andersen company.
I will have been learning this direction for two months and I will try to do my best.

## About me
Hi there! My name is **Aleh**. I am from **Belarus**.
I graduated from **Belarussian State Economic University with a degree in Economics**.
I worked in different companies such as banks, engineering companies,
grocery delivery companies. In general, those companies were government companies.
But no one of my positions was bringing me real pleasure.  

**The year 2020 in Belarus** was really worried and I, like many other people, decided
that I had to change my own life and started to do what I liked more to live better.
I have easily finished **Back-end Development Course with Python language**.
Also, I have been learning **Front-end technologies** on my own since 2021 to fully
develop my own applications and constantly grow as a web developer and not only.

## 3 reasons why I am interested in the course:
* **The first one** is that the DevOps direction is actual and constantly growing now
    and will be used in the future. 
* **The second one** is that I know Python language well enough and I am familiar with
    Linux OS at a minimum necessary level as I think.
* **The third one** is that the Andersen company provides an opportunity
    to get a traineeship or receive a job offer for those students
    who will successfully finish the training.

## 3 things that I expect from the course:
* **Firstly**, I expect knowledge that I will obtain to be actual and useful 
    for my future achievements. 
* **Secondly**, I expect I will successfully master a basic program for DevOps specialists
    and I will have one more chance to get an interesting job.
* **Thirdly**, of course, I expect to receive a job offer from Andersen
    if I graduate from the course **excellently**.
