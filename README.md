# Project overview
It's the DevOps course from the Andersen company. I will be learning that direction for two months and I will do be my best.

## About me
Hi there! My name is **Aleh**. I am 26 years old. I am from **Belarus**. I graduated from **Belarussian State Economic University with a degree in Economics**. I worked in different companies such as bank, engineering company, grocery delivery company. In general those companies were government companies. But no one of my positions were bringing me real pleasure.  
**Year 2020 in Belarus** was a really worried and I, like many other people, decided that I had to change my own life and started to do what I liked more to live better.  
I have easily finished **Back-end Development Course with Python language**. Also I have been learning **Front-end technologies** on my own since 2021 to fully develop my own applications and constantly grow as a web developer and not only.

## 3 reasons why I am interested in this course:
* The first one is that the DevOps direction is actual and constantly growing now and will be used in the future. 
* The second one is that I know Python language good enough and I am familiar with Linux OS at a minimal necessary level as I think.
* The third one is that the Andersen company provides an opportunity to get a traineeship or receive a job offer for those students who will successfully finish the training.

## 3 things what I expect from this course:
* Firstly, I expect knowledge that I will obtain to be actual and useful for my future achievements. 
* Secondly, I expect I will successfully master a basic program for DevOps specialist and I will have one chance more to get an interesting job.
* Thirdly, of course, I expect to receive a job offer from Andersen if I graduate the course **excellently**.
