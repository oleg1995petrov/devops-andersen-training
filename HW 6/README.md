# Project overview

Build a docker image for my [Flask app](https://oleg1995petrov/flask-app-for-devops-course).
  * The app listens only 8080 port.
  * The lighter in terms of image size it is - the more points I'll  get.
  * The one who build the smallest image gets even more points!

## The User Guide

1. Run the docker image and you are done:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 oleg1995petrov/flask-andersen:v2

    ```
