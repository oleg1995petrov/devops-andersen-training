# Homework overview

Build a docker image for my [Flask app][flask_app].
  * The app listens to only 8080 port.
  * The lighter in terms of image size it is - the more points I'll get.
  * The one who will build the smallest image will get even more points.

## Requirements
  
  * Docker

## The User Guide

1. Run the docker image and you are done:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm -p 8080:5000 oleg1995petrov/flask-andersen:v5
  ```
