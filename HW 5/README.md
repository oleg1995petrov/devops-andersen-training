# Project overview

* Write a script that checks if there are open pull requests for a repository. An url like "https://github.com/$user/$repo" will be passed to the script.
* Print the list of the most productive contributors (authors of more than 1 open PR).
* Print the number of PRs each contributor has created with the labels.
* Implement my own feature that I find the most attractive: anything from sorting to comment count or even fancy output format.
* Ask my chat mate to review my code and create a meaningful pull request.
* Do the same for him.
* Merge my fellow PR.
